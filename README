The RFID-lock project
=====================

The objective of this project is to implement an RFID-activated lock. The project is divided in two parts: in this module, we include all the code that will handle communication with the RFID reader, as well as reading and storing card numbers on an SD card.

In order to run, this project requires:

- an Arduino (obviously)
- an ethernet + SD shield (you can have the SD reader as a sepparate shield, as long as you update the SD_CARD_PIN constant)
- an RFID reader - the model in use is the Elechouse NetRFID (manual included)
- one text file on the SD card named "master.txt", with one line containing the card number of the *master* card

All the functionality is divided into C++ classes (eg.: RfidReader to encapsulate all interaction with the reader, Logger to save data to the SD card, Authorizer to validate cards)

HOW IT WORKS
------------
Every time you want to add a new card to the authorized list, all you have to do is:
- swipe the master card. You will hear two beeps, meaning the device is now in "record" mode
- swipe the new card. The authorized pin will fire and the card will automatically be added to the authorized cards list (cards.txt)

A valid swiping will simply send a HIGH digital signal to the LATCH_OUTPUT_PIN. The idea here is that any system can be "plugged" on that end - for instance, a magnetic latch, or simply a big blinking light that will beep when a valid card is swiped.


PENDING TASKS
-------------
- figure out a way to compile WITHOUT the Arduino IDE
- write C++ tests?

Building
--------

Install cmake
Install the arduino cmake toolchain
Point ARDUINO_TOOLCHAIN to your toolchain

e.g.: 
  export ARDUINO_TOOLCHAIN=~/Documents/git/arduino-cmake/cmake/ArduinoToolchain.cmake
